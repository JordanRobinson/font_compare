# Programming font comparison

Compares the most common (?) programming fonts. All font samples are from actual screenshots of the font taken under Windows 7 with Sublime Text.
 
For each font there's a light and dark theme and also the choice between AA (Anti-Aliasing) turned on and off. Note that there is no AA available for bitmap fonts as that would make no sense.
 
In the **overview** mode you can quickly compare all available fonts and select some for comparison. The red/green column is an AA indicator.
 
 In the **compare** mode the code sample is bigger and there is a wider range of font sizes to chose. The screenshot is for the activated font. It can be switched quickly by hovering over a font.

The code sample was chosen to showcase most common characters and common problems with fonts. The characters in the first line after the alphanumerics are:

	- the number one
	- Big i (indiana)
	- small L (lambda)
	- vertical bar
	- big L
	
	- number eight
	- number zero
	- big O (oregano)
	- small o
	
	- number five
	- big S (superman)
	
Following are some brackets, special characters, double underscore and a "hashtag".

The capturing process is automated, so font requests are welcome

## Font-specific notes
- **Monoid** and **Input** are both highly customizable, offering alternatives for commonly controversial letters. This site features only the default versions.
