# Programming font comparison

Compares the most common (?) programming fonts. All font samples are from actual screenshots of the font taken under Windows 7 with Sublime Text.
 
For each font there's a light and dark theme and also the choice between AA (Anti-Aliasing) turned on and off. Note that there is no AA available for bitmap fonts as that would make no sense.

There is also the choice between the default Windows font renderer (ClearType) and the replacement [gdipp](https://code.google.com/p/gdipp/), which "brings to you the effect of text like Mac OS and Linux".
 
In the **overview** mode you can quickly compare all available fonts with a fixed font size. You can select fonts with the checkboxes to mark them for comparison. The red/green column is an AA indicator.
 
In the **compare** mode the code sample is bigger and there is a wider range of font sizes to chose from. The screenshot is for the activated font (red). It can be switched quickly between the selections by hovering over them.

The code sample was chosen to showcase most common characters and problems with fonts. The characters in the first line after the alphanumerics are:

	- the number one
	- Big i (indiana)
	- small L (lambda)
	- vertical bar
	- big L
	
	- number eight
	- number zero
	- big O (oregano)
	- small o
	
	- number five
	- big S (superman)
	
Followed by some brackets, special characters, double underscore and a "hashtag".

The capturing process is automated, so requests for fonts or changes to the code sample are welcome.

## Font-specific notes
- **Monoid** and **Input** are both highly customizable, offering alternatives for commonly controversial letters. This site features only the default versions.
- **Office Code Pro** and **Meslo** also offer a Dotted Zero version.
